# Image_Segmentation_Tensorflow
developing and testing a convolutional neural network for semantic image segmentation?

There are different Models and Architecture of Convolutional Neural Network such as:

LeNET, AlexNET, VGG, U-Net, 

All these model have some common Convoulution layers
Convolutional Layer - the first layer that is used to extract the various features from the input images.

Pooling Layer - The primary aim of this layer is to decrease the size of the convolved feature map to 
reduce the computational costs.

Fully Connected Layer - consists of the weights and biases along with the neurons and is used to connect 
the neurons between two different layers

Dropout - Overfitting occurs when a particular model works so well on the training data causing a negative 
impact in the modelâ€™s performance when used on a new data.

Activation Functions - They are used to learn and approximate any kind of continuous and complex 
relationship between variables of the network. There are several commonly used activation functions 
such as the ReLU, Softmax, tanH and the Sigmoid functions.

This is aim to show case an understand how semantic image segmentation work using CNN models 

I choose to use U-Net because all neural network are use for a specific purpose on training neural network
for the purpose of this task I decide to use the U-Net.
